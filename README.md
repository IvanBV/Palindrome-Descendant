Palindrome Descendant task from edabit.com

https://edabit.com/challenge/PvCD5nSYy3Dnvnfcq

A number may not be a palindrome, but its descendant can be. A number's direct child is created by summing each pair of adjacent digits to create the digits of the next number.

For instance, 123312 is not a palindrome, but its next child 363 is, where: 3 = 1 + 2; 6 = 3 + 3; 3 = 1 + 2.

Create a function that returns true if the number itself is a palindrome or any of its descendants down to 2 digits (a 1-digit number is trivially a palindrome).
